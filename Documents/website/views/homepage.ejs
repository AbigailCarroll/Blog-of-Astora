<p> Hello! Welcome to my blog. This is the <%= newCount%><%= ordinal%> page view, thank you! </p>
<p> My name's Abigail, online I go by Astora. I mostly code and play Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons in between looking for a job. If you're a recruiter please email me at abigailcarroll50@gmail.com and I can send you my CV.</p>

<p> This website is hosted fully on my raspberry pi 3, currently sitting plugged in with a second hand micro usb next to my desk (say hi!).</p>

<p> All the HTML, CSS, and Nginx config was written by me, there's a little bit of javascript on the back-end that handles the view count and the ordinal, also written be me. The site is run locally with NodeJS and deployed through Nginx. </p>
<p> Oh! fun tidbit, I didn't want to pay for a new keyboard to use for the PI, so rather than learning to ssh into it from my laptop I downloaded an app that lets my phone act as a bluetooth keyboard. This decision has made my life worse in so many ways.</p>
<p> I've since learned from my mistakes and used PuTTY to SSH into the Pi. </p>
<p> All the code for this project can be found on my Github, linked at the top ^ </p>
